## About Page Copy (Future)

### The Story

I created My Second Brain because I was drowning in the invisible stuff.

Not the big things — the thousand small ones. What's for dinner. The teacher email I'd rewritten four times. The birthday party I said yes to without thinking. The permission slip that may or may not be signed.

My brain was full. And nobody was coming to empty it.

Then I started using AI differently. Not as a search engine. Not for generic advice. But as a thinking partner for the specific, messy, real situations in my actual life.

Game changer.

Now I share what works. Real prompts for real problems. No tech skills required. No judgment. Just relief.

Because you deserve a second brain.
